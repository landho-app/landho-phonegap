            </h2>
<div><p>Russia requires all visitors to have a Visa. To obtain a Visa it is first necessary to have a Letter of Invitation. Consultant Yacht Agent, Vladimir Ivankiv in St. Petersburg, can provide all the necessary paperwork, advice and assistance. He should be contacted well in advance.</p>
<p>Most yachts visiting Baltic Russia go to St Petersburg, but Kaliningrad, between Poland and Lithuania, is also Russian and a Visa necessary. Anyone intending to visit both Kaliningrad and St Petersburg must be aware that the same visa cannot be used for both visits. Vladimir will assist visitors.</p>
<p><span>As you cross the Russian border, call "Russian Coastguard" on Ch16 or 74. Give the name of the boat, callsign, position (lat &amp; long), course, speed, destination and number of persons on board. They may not speak English.</span></p>
<p><span><span>You MUST stay within a marked channel: it is absolutely forbidden for a foreign boat to stray more than 2M (preferably 1M) out of marked channels.</span></span></p>
<p>Foreign yachts must arrive with visas for each crew member obtained in advance and landfall must be made at one of the ports specified in the Visa (not that important as far as the ports of the Eastern Part of the Gulf of Finland are concerned). Yachts may be intercepted by a patrol boat at any time on entering territorial waters. If such a vessel does not answer calls on VHF Channel 16, one should try Channel 10, which is their normal working channel.</p>
<p>Yachts should be attentive as to where they enter Russian territorial waters. In the Finnish Gulf it is recommended to follow the Sea Channel and cross the territorial water line between Gogland (Hochland) Island and Moshniy. Most yachts clearing our of Finland at Haapasaari Island normally cross the territorial water line between Gogland and Sommers Islands. At this point one should attempt to raise the authorities on VHF Channel 16. Unless instructed otherwise, proceed to the terminal at Kronstadt for clearance. Some yachts have been fined for entering Russian territorial waters in a non-approved place.</p>
<p>It is forbidden to stop at any of the islands in Russian waters. Sheltering from bad weather is not considered a valid reason. It was mentioned at one of the meetings of the St.Petersburg Coast Guard with the local yachtsmen that sheltering from "real" bad weather would be considered a valid reason. The Biorkesund Passage is also closed to yachts at present. There is pressure on the authorities to open both Gogland Island and the Biorkesund Passage to yachts, which would save some sea miles.</p>
<p>The alternative entry point into Russia is from Finland via the Saimaa Canal. Here one can clear in at Vyborg or Brusnichnoye and proceed to St Petersburg via Vysozk. This route, which is used by Finnish boats, has been reported as being simpler and with less red tape.</p>
<p>Foreign vessels must clear in and out with the Frontier Guard, Customs and Immigration in all ports of entry. No one must leave the boat until formalities have been completed; officials will come to the boat.</p>
<p>Foreign vessels are required to notify the authorities in the next port one intends to visit three days in advance, with a crew list, boat details and purpose of visit.(Vlad.Ivankiv/or an agent is expected to provide the authorities with such info anyway).</p>
<p>Vessels which seek shelter or stop in ports not mentioned in the visa may have difficulties. If wishing to stop at a port where there are no officials, permission to do so and clearance must be obtained from the nearest port of entry.</p>
<p>Note that if sailing between Poland and Lithuania and not intending to visit Kaliningrad, it is necessary to remain about 20NM offshore when passing this area to avoid the attention of Russion Patrol boats (territorial waters extend only 12NM but they often venture further out and will question any boats they see.</p>
<p>Yachts intending to combine a visit to the Saimaa Lakes in Finland with a visit to St Petersburg are advised to visit St Petersburg first. Problems have been experienced because passports have been stamped when transiting the Saimaa Canal (which runs through Russian territory) and this has been interpreted as using the Visa needed for St Petersburg.</p>
<p>The authorities must be notified 24 hours in advance of departure.</p>
<p>In summary, visiting Russia by private yacht is difficult and, if not part of a pre-arranged rally, involves a lot of questioning, suspicion and paperwork. This is especially the case at the Black Sea ports, visiting which is not currently advisable.</p>
<p>An agent must be employed for the clearing in procedure.</p>

            </h2>
<div><p>Passports must be valid for 6 months after the end of your visit.</p>
<p>On arrival, yachts do not have to stop at Fort Konstantin, Kronshtadt for Passport Control any longer. They are expected to go directly to the Passenger Sea Terminal for clearing Customs/Immigration.</p>
<p>The maximum stay on a tourist visa is 4 weeks the dates of which must be declared in advance. You can arrive after the declared start date but must clear out on or before the end date.</p>
<p>All nationalities must obtain a visa in advance. There are convenient Russian diplomatic missions in Helsinki, Nicosia (Cyprus) and Istanbul, where visas can be obtained. It is recommended to apply for a visa at the consulate where one will receive the visa, and not to try to pick it up from another consulate as the various bureaucratic formalities may differ from one place to another and often change. The consulate will advise what they require.</p>
<p>Yachts arriving without visas for all crew members may be turned away. Difficulties will also be encountered if there are any irregularities at all with one's passport or visa - for example, if either is past its expiry date.</p>
<p>The visa is a separate document which lists the places for which one has been given permission to visit, and the dates of one's stay.</p>
<p>It is best to apply for a business or invited guest visa as this kind of visa allows for a greater flexibility in the matter of the timing of your arrival. This type of visa is issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the consulates come under the wing of this Ministry also.</p>
<p>Tourist visas are issued by the OVIR department in the Ministry of Home Affairs, and obtaining one of these takes longer. Such visas are usually very restricted in dates, as they are meant for air travellers on prearranged holidays.</p>
<p>To get the visa it is necessary to have an official invitation endorsed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and issued by one of the organisations such as yacht clubs or agencies that have an agreement with the Ministry.</p>
<p>It is necessary to have a berthing reservation voucher for the boat. This can be done by contacting Mr Vladimir Ivankiv well in advance (at least 2 months). <i>See details below</i>.</p>
<p>Vladimir is a long-standing yachtsman who now is full time helping cruising sailors visiting Russia. He will need the following information:-</p>
<ul>
<li>earliest arrival date</li>
<li>latest departure date: this can be no more than one month after arrival; you can arrive &amp; leave any time between these 2 dates</li>
<li>full names as on passports</li>
<li>dates of birth</li>
<li>passport numbers</li>
<li>nationalities</li>
<li>mobile number</li>
<li>boat's name</li>
<li>LOA</li>
<li>beam</li>
<li>draft</li>
<li>registration number</li>
<li>colour of hull</li>
<li>sail number</li>
<li>callsign</li>
<li>engine type &amp; number</li>
<li>home port</li>
</ul>
<p><span>He will then email you the Tourist Voucher and Tourist Confirmation Document and make the booking at a yacht club (either Central River YV or Krestovski YC).</span></p>
<p>You can then start the process of applying for a visa. You will need a certificate of health insurance valid for Russia.</p>
